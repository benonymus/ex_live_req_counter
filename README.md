# ExLiveReqCounter

While I was working on https://github.com/benonymus/ex_ddos/tree/mint_version
I thought it would be nice to validate the request count that was collected in the application.
Hence I created this project.

You can create a new key and send your requests to the corresponding api link to increase the request count. 
The liveview page will track you the requests in real time.

It is deployed here: https://ex-live-req-counter.fly.dev
